# Fonts

Here should be all fonts that will be used on site that are served by our server (beside those from remote services like Google, Typekit, etc).

Each font should be in its own directory, including all web formats:

* **TTF/OTF** All, IE only if set to be `installable`
* **WOFF** IE 9+, Android 4.4.4+, all of the others
* **WOFF2** Only FF 39+, Chrome 43+, Opera 31+ Android 44+
* **SVG** None except Safari, iOS
* **EOT** IE: all, none of the other
